# Eses Image Effect Bloom

![Eses Image Effect Bloom Node Screenshot](docs/image_effect_bloom.png)

## Description

The 'Eses Image Effect Bloom' is a ComfyUI custom node that provides a configurable bloom effect. It simulates the natural glow of bright light sources in a photographic image, allowing for artistic bloom effects using a GPU-accelerated PyTorch backend for real-time performance. 

üí° If you have ComfyUI installed, you don't need any extra dependencies!

 ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING - **Blur effects can be (in general) quite slow, despite GPU acceleration!** 
  * When source image is large you may have to wait for a while, but image sizes like 2048x2048 should render in relatively short time.

 üß† Don't expect any magical results, your image has to have discrete highlights, surrounded by overall darker environment, this way brighter areas can be emphasized.


## Features

* **Controllable Highlight Isolation**:
    * `low_threshold`: Sets the black point for the highlights, controlling what is considered a "bright" light source.
    * `high_threshold`: Sets the white point, allowing you to fine-tune the range of highlights included in the bloom effect.


* **Glow Controls**:
    * `blur_type`: Choose between a high-quality `gaussian` blur or a performance-friendly `box` blur for the glow.
    * `blur_radius`: Controls the size and softness of the glow, from a tight sheen to a wide, hazy aura.
    * `highlights_brightness`: A multiplier to increase the intensity of the glow *before* it's blended, creating a more powerful light emission.


* **Compositing Options**:
    * `blend_mode`: A suite of blend modes (`screen`, `add`, `overlay`, `soft_light`, `hard_light`) to control how the glow interacts with the base image.
    * `fade`: A final opacity slider to adjust the overall strength of the bloom effect.


## Requirements

* PyTorch ‚Äì (you should have this if you have ComfyUI installed).


## Installation

1.  **Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:**
    ```
    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```
2.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/quasiblob/ComfyUI-EsesImageEffectBloom.git
    ```
3.  **Restart ComfyUI:**
    * After restarting, the "Eses Image Effect Bloom" node will be available in the "Eses Nodes/Image Adjustments" category.


## Folder Structure

```
ComfyUI-EsesImageEffectBloom/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.py                     # Main module defining the custom node.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image_effect_bloom.py       # The Python file containing the node logic.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This file.
```


## Usage

* Connect an `image` tensor to the corresponding input. 
* Adjust the `low_threshold` and `high_threshold` sliders to isolate the parts of the image you want to glow. 
* Configure the `blur_radius`, `highlights_brightness`, and `blend_mode` to achieve the desired effect. 
* The node outputs the final `modified_image`, the generated `highlights_image` for diagnostics, and a passthrough of the original `image`.

üß† Enable `Run (On Change)` from ComfyUI's toolbar to get automatic preview updates, when you modify node values. Connect both the `modified_image` and `highlights_image` to image preview nodes to see the results!


## Inputs

* **image** (`IMAGE`, *required*): The input image to apply the effect to.
* **mask** (`MASK`, *optional*): A passthrough mask. The effect is not currently maskable.


## Outputs

* **modified_image** (`IMAGE`): The final image with the bloom effect applied.
* **highlights_image** (`IMAGE`): The isolated, blurred glow layer before it's composited.
* **image** (`IMAGE`): A passthrough of the original input image.
* **mask** (`MASK`): A passthrough of the original input mask.
